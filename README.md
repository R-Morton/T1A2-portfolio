## Presentation
()

The purpose of this website is to put myself up for display, giving a bit of background about myself while also displaying what I can do when it comes to building a website.

This wesbite includes a navbar at the top, giving access to all pages except for the individual blog articles. The desktop version includes abit of hover animation on these nav buttons.
The home page is just a simple introduction with photo and title and a background image for looks.
The about me page has more information about myself and a link to my resume and social media. I do not have an instagram or twitter account so they just link to the home page. However my LinkedIn profile is linked.
The blog page contains a list of links to my 5 individual blogs. Each individual blog is its own page, all with placeholder text (lorem ipsum).
The contact me page has details of how to contact me (fake details for the purpose of this assignment) as well as a form in which you can input your name and email to receive updates about my blog. This has no functionality after clicking submit.


### Sitemap
