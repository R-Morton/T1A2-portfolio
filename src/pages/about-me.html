                <h1>Rhys Morton - Web Developer</h1>
                <p>Hello! My name is Rhys Morton and I am currently studying Web Development with Coder Academy! 
                I was born in Cardiff, Wales and moved to Australia in 1999 and shortly after, received citizenship here. As I grew up, I always took an interest in technology and enjoyed building things and understanding how electronics worked.
                <p>During high school, I got my first job in the hospitality industry and have been continuing in that industry to this very day. Lately have been in management roles, improving my skills on team management and people skills.</p>
                <p>Now i feel it is my time to learn the skills I am passionate about which is why I am now studying this course with Coder Academy. I would like to eventually combine my management skills I have learnt with the current skills I am learning.</p>
                <p>My key values I consider neccessary for my success are my problem solving skills, ability to work with others effeciently and my solid, hard work ethic.</p>
                <p>I am very much looking forward to learning as much as I can from this course, to get my foot into the industry and progress my career from there!</p>
